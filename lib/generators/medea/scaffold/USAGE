Description:
    Scaffolds an entire resource, from model to controller and
    views. The resource is ready to use as a starting point for your restful,
    resource-oriented application. Tests or specs are also generated depending
    on if you have a "spec" directory or not.

Usage:
    Pass the name of the model, either CamelCased or under_scored, as the first
    argument along with an optional list of attribute pairs and controller actions.

    If no controller actions are specified, they will default to index, show,
    new, create, edit, update, and destroy.

    For example, `medea:scaffold post` gives you a model, a controller that handles
    the create/show/update/destroy, forms to create and edit your posts, and
    an index that lists them all, as well as a map.resources :posts
    declaration in config/routes.rb.

    Adding an "!" in the mix of arguments will invert the passed controller
    actions. This will include all 7 controller actitons except the ones
    mentioned. This option doesn't affect model attributes.

Examples:
    rails generate medea:scaffold post

        Will create a controller called "posts" it will contain all seven
        CRUD actions along with the views. A model will also be created.

    rails generate medea:scaffold post ! show new

        Creates a posts model and controller with index, edit, update, and
        destroy actions.

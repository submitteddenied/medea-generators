Description:
    Initialises the settings required to use JasonDB from your Rails application.
    Also patches config/application.rb to remove the dependency on active record.
    Topics created are:
      <base>-dev    # Used in the rails development environment
      <base>-test   # Used in the rails test environment
      <base>        # Used in the rails production environment

Usage:
    Pass the name of your desired topic (JasonDB namespace), and a username and password.
    Note that all three of these fields are optional and can be randomly generated for you.

Examples:
    rails generate medea:init

        Will initialise database.yml, add the JasonDB initialiser, patch application.rb,
        generate a topic base, username and password and create the topic(s) on JasonDB.

    rails generate medea:init myapp user_name p@$$w0rD

        Will do the same as above, but will use 'myapp' as the topic base, 'user_name' as the
        user name and 'p@$$w0rD' as the password in database.yml and when creating the topics
        on JasonDB.
